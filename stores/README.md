Stores is a script that allows players to rob various gas stations and liqour stores.

# Features:
- Allows you to hold up the store clerk with a gun and receive money.
- Eventually, the store will run out of money and you have a random chance to get the safe code.
- If you get the safe code you can open it in the back and it will require the code.
- Safe payout is between 1500-2500 grand cash.
- If you run too far away the safe will be 'reset remotely' (code won't work anymore)
- Every store can be cleared and will be reset every 30 minutes.
